I useed to be a shepherd in the Lub region of France.
 It was a very isolated place,, so I was often all alone in the pasture.
Sometimes, I did not see many people for weeks.
During those weeks, I only had my dog and the flocks of sheep to ccompany
me.

 From time to time, I saw a loner who lived on Mount llure.
 He would come down to hear some news of the outside wourld.
 Also, I sometimes saw coal miners.
 They worked in the coal mines near my field, so I spoke with them 
as they ewnt back and forth to the coal mines.

 Once every two weeks, I got a visitor from the farm.
This person was usually the farm boy or an old woman who worked at the farm.
 They were sent to bring me supplies on a mule. I was always happy to see them.
They would tell me all of the news from the lowlands.

 However, the news that interested me the most was about my master"s daughter.
Her name was Stephanette, and she was the most beautiful girl in the surrounding area.
Without seeming to take too much insterest, I would ask how Stephanette was doing.
I asked if there were any young men who wanted to marry her.

 Of course, I was just a lowly shepherd who worked for her father. I had to remind 
myself that there was no way that there was no way that Stephanette would be 
interested in me. After all, there were many wealthy and handsome young men in the area.
 One Sunday, I was waiting for the delivery boy to arrive. It had been two weeks since my 
last delivery, so I was running out of supplies. By ten o'clock, no one had arrived yet.

 "That's odd,"I thought. "There must be a problem at my master's house."
 I continued to wait, but no one came by noon.  "They must have forgotten to
send my supplies," I said to myself.
 Around noon, I notic3e that a big storm was coming.
In the distance, some dark clouds were gathering. Soon, heavy rain began to 
pour down. "Now I understand," I said to myself.

 "The bad weather has delayed the delivery person. The roads must be muddy by now.                              
 I should not expect him to arrive yet.
 A few hours later, the storm was over. The sun shone high in the sky, and its warm rays
spread bright light all over the fields.

 All of a sudden, I heard the familiar sound of the mule's bells. I eagerly looked to see 
if it was the farmhand or the old woman. However, it was neither the famhand nor
the old woman. It was the beautiful Stephanette! Oh, what a wonderful surprise that 
was!  She got off the mule, and then she said to me, "I got lost on my way up the hill.
